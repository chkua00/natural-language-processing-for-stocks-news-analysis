# Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Stocks News Analysis

In this hands-on project, we will train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to perform stocks sentiment analysis. Natural language processing (NLP) works by converting words (text) into numbers, these numbers are then used to train an AI/ML model to make predictions. In this project, we will build a machine learning model to analyze thousands of Twitter tweets to predict people's sentiment towards a particular company or stock. The algorithm could be used automatically understand the sentiment from public tweets, which could be used as a factor while making buy/sell decision of securities.

## Tasks

The hands on project on Natural Language Processing for Stocks News Analysis is divided into following tasks:

- Task 1: Understand the Problem Statement and business case

- Task 3: Perform Data Cleaning (Remove Punctuations)
- Task 4: Perform Data Cleaning (Remove Stop words)
- Task 5: Plot Word Cloud
- Task 6: Visualize Cleaned Datasets
- Task 7: Prepare the data by tokenizing and padding
- Task 8: Understand the theory and intuition behind LSTM
- Task 9: Build and train the model
